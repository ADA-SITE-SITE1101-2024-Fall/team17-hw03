            <h2>Hour of Code</h2>
            <p>The journey we began has aimed at capturing students' attention through a coding lesson using Code.org, which makes algorithms simpler for understanding better.
                <p>We decided to begin with giving information about ADA university. We delivered introductory presentation of ADA University, giving the background information, unparalleled opportunities that it grants, and success stories of graduate students. Then, Team 17 asked several questions related to this event. According to the students, they have never had such an event, and they were excited after hearing about the interactive tasks that it held. Some of them did not possess a phone; therefore, deciding to be more flexible, the interactive tasks were shown on a projected screen, where students could try to solve them. All of the tasks were easily completed in time. They really adored such opportunity and expressed gratitude altogether.
