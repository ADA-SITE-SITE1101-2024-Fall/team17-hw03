            <h2>Background   Information</h2>
            <p>We are Team 17, consisting of 4 members: Huseyn Ibrahimov, Murad Abbasov, Nazrin Gadirli, and Jala Garayeva. We are excited to share our journey together!</p>
            <p>Starting off with the first project, building various gates on the breadboard, we passionately learned many things about working together.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, utilizing the experience that we had gained, we organized our Hour of Code event in the Technical-Humanitarian Lyceum.</p>
            <p>As some of the equipment were not available, we decided to adapt to those conditions and used the provided laptop with the projected screen <br> to showcase interactive tasks that were freely accessible on Code.org website.</p> 
            <p>It was very insightful and unique interactions were also quite enjoyable.</p>
