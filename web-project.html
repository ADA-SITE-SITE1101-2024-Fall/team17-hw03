            <h2>Understanding Websites</h2>
            <p>A website is the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one unit. First, HTML constructs a solid layout, dividing content into paragraphs, headings, images, and more. Then, you use CSS to develop its presentation: layout, color, font, etc., so it would be visually appealing. Finally, entering JavaScript provides interactivity, enabling dynamic content change responding to user actions, and easy communication with servers. All together, these technologies harmoniously combine to present a whole web experience, with HTML providing the structural backbone, CSS the aesthetics, and JavaScript orchestrating dynamic functionality.</p>

            <h2>About Our Project</h2>
            <p>Team 17 proudly presents this website, designed in four different sections. The first part, for example, is a pretty good overview of what we did in our involvement with the Hour of Code event under this primary heading. Then the events section would talk about how we taught using code.org, with the incorporation of some magnificent photographs and another enriching video where JavaScript did its magic in the photo section. The third part, known as "About Us," has our team members with what they have contributed to the committee. Finally, this is the last part of our journey, which will include how the website works, what exactly we have as our project, and a recognition of the hard work that has gone into the process thanks to Codecademy.</p>
